  <h3>Here are 10 facts that<br>you maybe didn't know!</h3>
  
 
    1 Cheaper by the pound: The so-called Subway Garnet was sold within a day,<br> reportedly for $100—just $2,300 in today’s dollars.<br>

 2 The unit of measure for gemstones had humble beginnings. “Carat” comes from the Greek keration,<br> or “carob bean,” which was used as a standard for weighing small quantities. It is equivalent to 200 milligrams,<br> or about 0.007 ounce.<br>

3  When Richard Burton bought Elizabeth Taylor the heart-shaped Taj-Mahal diamond,<br> he is said to have bragged, “It has so many carats, it’s almost a turnip.”<br>

4  A “fancy intense pink” diamond recently set a world record when it was purchased<br> at auction for $46 million by a London jeweler.<br>

5  The Cullinan diamond is the largest known gem diamond—or, actually, was. It weighed 3,106 carats,<br> or nearly a pound and a half, when it was discovered in South Africa in 1905, <br>but it has since been cut into more than 100 stones.<br>

6    The Cullinan stones, all flawless, are now part of the British Regalia. The largest, <br>a 530-carat behemoth, is set in one of the British royal scepters.<br>

7  For the rest of us, there is crystallized sodium chloride, otherwise known as salt.<br> We are literally awash in it: If the water were evaporated from the world’s oceans, we’d be left with 4.5 million cubic miles of salt,<br> equivalent to a cube measuring 165 miles on each side.<br>

8  Another crystal for commoners: sugar. Each American eats an average of more than 130<br> pounds of it per year.<br>

9  As if sugar’s ties to obesity and tooth decay weren’t enough, new research out of Imperial College <br>London suggests that it contributes to high blood pressure, too.<br>

10 Snow is near-pure crystallized water, but when it collects on the ground it acts as<br> a reservoir for atmospheric pollutants such as mercury and soot. So you probably shouldn’t eat the white snow either.<br>
